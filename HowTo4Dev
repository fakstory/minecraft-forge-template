Building and Testing Your Mod
To build your mod, run gradlew build. This will output a file in build/libs with the name  [archivesBaseName]-[version].jar. This file can be placed in the mods folder of a forge enabled Minecraft setup, and distributed.
To test run with your mod, the easiest way is to use the run configs that were generated when you set up your project. Otherwise, you can run gradlew runClient. This will launch Minecraft from the <runDir> location, including your mod code. There are various customizations to this command. Consult the ForgeGradle cookbook for more information.
You can also run a dedicated server using the server run config, or gradlew runServer. This will launch the Minecraft server with itâ€™s GUI.
